# RFID to DB
I want to develop an easier way for teachers to track attendance instead of wasting valuable time doing a roll call. This project uses RFID tags that registered to students that check in each time they come to class. The teacher would then have access to this information via an Android application for phone or tablet. This paper walks through the waterfall process (Concept, Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance) of that project with a conclusion and recommended improvements at the end.

The “RFIDtoDB.ino” is a sketch for the microcontroller. There are “lua” files that are scripts that connect to the database and query the database. The folder “RFIDCam” contains the Android Studio project that is for the mobile device.
